              Driven by a lifelong debate between art and science, I blend

              With a background in dentistry and 4 years of practice, I
              transitioned to Spain, focusing on digital skillsâ€”marketing,
              design, and social media.{" "}

              Working at a large-scale company sparked my interest in digital

              eager to contribute to the digital transformation, especially in
