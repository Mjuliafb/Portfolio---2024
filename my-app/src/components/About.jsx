              Driven by a lifelong debate between art and science, I blend
              limitless creativity with measurable outcomes for societal impact.
              With a background in dentistry and 4 years of practice, I
              transitioned to Spain, focusing on digital skillsâ€”marketing,
              design, and social media.{" "}

              Working in a large-scale company sparked my interest in digital
              health, bridging my passions. I pursued a master's in digital
              health and now venture into full-stack development. I'm now eager
              to contribute to the digital transformation in healthcare, expand
              my skill set and explore new opportunities. ðŸŽ¯{" "}
